## SpeakSmart Client â€“ Production Readiness Update

Hi everyone!

I'm preparing SpeakSmart for production. Recently, I transitioned the backend from a Python-heavy service to a scalable Spring Boot architecture. This change will help us handle more users and deliver faster, more reliable analysis features.

### Current Status
- The platform is being actively improved for stability and scalability.
- There might be some issues with the analysis results right now, but I'm working hard to fix them.
- If you encounter bugs or have suggestions, please email me at **amanverma404403@gmail.com**.

### New Features & Roadmap
- **Social Login:** Added Google, GitHub, and LinkedIn for easy sign-in.
- **Upcoming Features:**
  - Online Group Discussions (GD)
  - Debates
  - Open Mic sessions
  - Role-based conversations

### A Note on UI & Admin Privileges
If you suddenly see the UI crashing or get admin privileges, don't panic! That's just me testing things live on production ðŸ˜‚. Please bear with me as I continue to improve the platform.

Hope you find SpeakSmart useful and enjoy the new features as they roll out. Thanks for being part of this journey!
